<h1 style="text-align:center;">Trekking</h1><br>
 <p>Being a soft-adventure sport, almost anyone in reasonable physical condition can go trekking. To get initiated into trekking begin with day hikes, returning to your starting point in the evening. Move on to a multi-day trek which is relatively easy, in order to get to know your ability and aptitude. You can venture into the mountains with an experienced trekker, join an adventure club, or go with a reputed adventure travel company. It is not a good idea to venture out into the mountains alone â€“ unless you happen to be a distant relative of the mythical Himalayan yeti (or an aspiring Reinhold Messner, the first person in the world to have climbed all fourteen 8000m peaks, including the first oxygen-less ascent and later the first solo ascent of Everest).</p>

<p>We had the best family adventure holiday at Camp Crossfire. The facilities were excellent, but what really made the holiday was the hospitality. I would love to visit again. Thank you Camp Crossfire!</p>
